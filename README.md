A new Flutter application.
I love travelling and I wished to make an application that shows all the amazing places I can visit.
This application is one step closer to realising my dream, there is a lot of work to do on this application but I have laid the foundation.

All the images I have used do not belong to me, they have been downloaded from wikipedia or google images.
